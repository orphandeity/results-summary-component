## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [Vite](https://vite.dev/) - Frontend Tooling
- [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/) - Frontend Framework


### What I learned

I wanted to use this project to refamiliarize myself with vanilla CSS after exclusively using TailwindCSS for the better part of the past year.  I also took the opportunity to explore custom properties.


### Continued development

I really liked writing CSS again and will continue exploring custom properties.
